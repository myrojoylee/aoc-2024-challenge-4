## Notes/What I learned

I learned how to use pseudo-elements to create this effect. Additionally, using the `flex` property to define container is not something I do frequently but I was able to understand how `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis` work a bit better.

## Credits

The CSS technique using a flex-based solution with pseudo-elements were adapted from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5214127/css-technique-for-a-horizontal-line-with-words-in-the-middle).
